Netrics - Active Measurement of Network Performance

## 1. [About Netrics](https://chicago-cdac.github.io/nm-exp-active-netrics)

<b>What</b>: a software framework to concentrate and run dedicated computer network measurements.<br>
<b>For Whom</b>: internet users, network engineers and the general internet research community.<br>
<b>Why</b>: to troubleshoot impaired computer networks, to understand how the internet is evolving, and to support decisions on internet infrastructure capacity planning.

### 1.1 Hardware

Netrics runs on dedicated SBC's (Single Board Computers) like the Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson Nano or any other Ubuntu [amd64](https://github.com/chicago-cdac/nm-exp-active-netrics/releases) compatible device. The active Netrics package (this repo) is mainly responsible for measurements that actively generate network traffic in order to assess network's performance metrics. As a complement to the active measurements, the [passive](https://github.com/chicago-cdac/nm-exp-passive-netrics) Netrics can produce network perfomance metrics from passively listening to the network. The latter does require complementary hardware in order to produce performance data.

### 1.2 Source Code, Configuration and Data locations

The python source code, after installed resides on:<br>
`/usr/local/src/nm-exp-active-netrics/*`<br>

The local data (SBC storage) is located at:<br>
`/var/nm/nm-exp-active-netrics/upload/pending/*` (pending upload),<br>
`/var/nm/nm-exp-active-netrics/upload/archive/*` (uploaded, safe for deletion)<br>

Configuration can be found at:<br>
`/etc/nm-exp-active-netrics/*`

## 2. Install

Please use the _unmanaged_ installation with direct influxdb data ingestion if you're a developer or researcher planning to contribute with code, testing and building of NetMicroscope/Netrics Open Source software. For all other cases, please use the _managed_ installation method.

### 2.1 Install (umanaged, direct influxfb data ingestion)

1. Checkout the latest pre-releases and releases at [link](https://github.com/chicago-cdac/nm-exp-active-netrics/releases).
2. Copy link and login into your Jetson Nano device, download .deb file:<br>
`wget https://github.com/chicago-cdac/nm-exp-active-netrics/releases/download/v0.1.10-arm64/nm-exp-active-netrics-v0.1.10-arm64.deb`
3. run `sudo apt install ./nm-exp-active-netrics-v0.1.10-arm64.deb`<br>
(To reinstall run):<br>`sudo apt remove --purge nm-exp-active-netrics`<br>`sudo apt install --reinstall ./nm-exp-active-netrics-v0.1.10-arm64.deb`, and if necessary run:<br>`sudo rm -Rf /usr/local/src/nm-exp-active-netrics`
4. edit your `/etc/nm-exp-active-netrics/nm-exp-active-netrics.toml` file to include <b>[iperf]</b> target servers:
```
...
[iperf]

   targets = ["server:33001"]
...
```
5. Create .env.netrics file with server credentials <b>`sudo vim /etc/nm-exp-active-netrics/.env.netrics`</b>:
<pre>
INFLUXDB_SERVER=
INFLUXDB_PORT=
INFLUXDB_USERNAME=
INFLUXDB_PASSWORD=
INFLUXDB_DATABASE=
INSTALL_ID=<b>myid</b> <---- use your lastname here so you can filter out grafana/influxdb queries.
</pre>
6. Restart netrics: <b>`sudo /etc/init.d/nm-exp-active-netrics restart`</b>
7. Check health with `netrics -C` and logs with `netrics -L`

### 1.2 Install (managed, via nm-mgmt-cms-*.deb)
